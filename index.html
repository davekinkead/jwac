  <h1>JWAC Analysis</h1>

  <h3><a href="structure.html">Structural Analysis</a></h3>

  <h3><a href="member.html">Member Analysis</a></h3>
  <p>Like the flow analysis but at an individual level</p>

  <h3><a href="flow.html" title="coming soon">Flow Analysis (not working)</a></h3>
  <p>A temporal view of the training pipeline.  The x-axis is time meaning we are view how cohorts move in 'real' life.</p>

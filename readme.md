# JWAC Cohort Analysis & Forecasting

The idea is to overlay PMKeys data with an interactive JS dashboard based on a Sankey Funnel.

Each JWAC cohort needs to pass through the following gates:

Entries

  - NEOC
  - Transfer
  - Backclass
  - Changeovers
  - Overseas

Gates (Optional)

  - Phase I
  - Phase II
  - MSB
  - ADFA (Optional)
  - Phase III Shore
  - Phase III Sea
  - Fleet Board 
  - NOLC 1
  - JWAC Warfare
  - Phase IV Bsim 
  - Phase IV PE

Exits

  - Resignation
  - Back class
  - Training Failure
  - Medical
  - Not Recommended
